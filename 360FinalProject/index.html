        <h1>8-Ball</h1>
        <h2>APA League Rules</h2>
        <p>8-ball is played with a cue ball and normal rack of fifteen (15) object balls. Balls are
          racked with the front ball on the foot spot and the 8-ball in the center. The purpose of the game is for one
          player to pocket the solid colored group of balls numbered 1 to 7 or the striped balls from 9-15. Choice of balls
          to be pocketed is made by the player pocketing the first ball of the game. A player wins by pocketing all their
          object balls followed by legally pocketing the 8-ball in a called pocket.</p>

          <h1>Lag: Rule 1</h1> 
          <p>Method used to start a match. Players shoot a ball from behind the headstring, banking
            it off the foot rail and back to the head of the table. Striking the side rails or any pocket results in the
            loss of the lag. The closest ball to the head rail wins. It is permissible to strike the head rail. If the lagged balls
            make contact with each other, lag over.</p>

          <h1>Breaking: Rule 2</h1>
          <p>"Breaking safe" or soft is not allowed. For a break to be legal, at least four balls must be driven
            to the rails or a ball must be pocketed. Otherwise, the balls are re-racked and re-broken by the same player. A
            game not legally broken but resulting in a scratch or foul will be re-racked and broken by the opposite player.
            The rack must be struck before a foul can occur. The head ball or the second ball must be struck on the break
            and the cue ball may not be shot into the rail before the rack. The League Operator may make judgments and
            issue penalties to teams and players who are not breaking hard. Breaking just hard enough to comply with this
            rule is not a guarantee against penalties. Break as hard as you can with control.</p>

          <h1>After the Break: Rule 3</h1>
          <p>Various circumstances can occur upon completion of the break; they are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A foul in the break results in "Ball in hand" behind the headstring and the incoming player has an
              open table as defined in "Se." The incoming player must shoot any ball outside the headstring. A ball
              that's dead center or "out" is playable. 1f it is "in". the ball is not playable. It is up to the opponent to
              call the cue ball "in" before it is shot. 
            </li>
            <li>No balls are pocketed and it is the other player's turn.</li>
            <li>The 8-ball is made. resulting in a win, unless the player scratches.</li>
            <li>One ball is made, it is still the breaker's turn and they continue shooting the category of balls they just made.</li>
            <li>One of each type ball is made. The breaker has their choice of balls. They may shoot any ball, except the
                8-ball, and each pocketed ball counts. If they make one of each on their second shot, they still have an open
                table. If they miss on their second shot, their opponent has an "open table." "Open table" means a player
                can shoot a combination involving a stripe and a solid and whichever they make would be their ball.
            </li>
            <li>If two balls of one type and one ball of the other type are pocketed, it is the shooter's choice just as in shown above.</li>

          <h1>Combination Shots: Rule 4</h1> 
          <p>Combination shots are legal, but striking the correct ball first is required except in
            an "open table" situation. The 8-ball is not neutral. A player is credited with all balls they legally pocket. When
            a player does not pocket one of their balls but pocket's an opponent's ball, they lose their turn. The opponent gets
            credit for the pocketed ball. No pocketed ball is ever spotted.</p>

          <p>If the 8-ball is knocked on the floor, it is loss of game. Object balls knocked on the
            floor are spotted. If the spot is taken, the ball is placed on a line directly behind the spot as close as possible.
            Knocking a ball other than the cue ball on the floor is not a foul. It might occur that a player pockets their ball
            while simultaneously knocking another ball on the floor. In that situation, it is still their turn and the ball is not
            spotted until they miss. If the ball on the floor is one of the shooter's balls, it is spotted when the shooter had
            pocketed all their other balls or misses.</p>

            not have them. There is no foul - simply stop the shooter and hand them the bridge.</p>

          <h1>Fouls: Rule 9</h1> 
          <p>If any of the following fouls are committed, the penalty is "ball in hand" for the incoming player.
            Make certain you have "ball in hand" before you touch the cue ball by confirming with your opponent. "Ball in
            hand" means you are allowed to place the cue ball anywhere on the table (with the exception of fouls on the
            break which result in "ball in hand" behind the head string) and shoot any of your balls (or the 8, if all your
            category of balls have been pocketed.) Even after placing the cue ball, a player may, if not satisfied with the
            placement, make further adjustments with the hand, cue stick or any other piece of equipment. A foul is called
            only if the player fouls while actually stroking the cue ball, meaning a double hit of the cue ball (sometimes
            called double clutching). Without this rule, a player could benefit by accidentally or purposely scratching or fouling. </p>

          properly call the pocket, a coaster or some other mutually agreed upon marker must be placed next
